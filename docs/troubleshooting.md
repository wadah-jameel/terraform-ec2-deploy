Security Notes

⚠️ Important Security Considerations:

    The security group allows SSH access from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0). For production, restrict this to your specific IP address.
    Make sure to use a strong key pair and keep your private key secure.
    Consider using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager instead of SSH for better security.


Customization Options

You can easily customize this basic setup by:

    Changing the AMI to use different operating systems
    Modifying the user data script for different applications
    Adding additional security group rules
    Using different instance types
    Adding tags for better resource management
